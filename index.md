# About Me

<img src="/images/shitao.jpg" class="floatpic" width="200" height="200">
My name is Shitao Wang.  I am a graduate student at the [Rosenstiel School of Marine
and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS)] in the Ocean Science Department (OCE), working with Dr.
[Mohamed Iskandarani].
I started working at RSMAS in 2012 pursuing my MS, which I completed in 2015
Summer. After that, I started my PhD degree.

My research focus on the development, validation and application of Uncertainty
Quantification (UQ) tools in physical oceanography. Specifically, our project
concerns the UQ in the oil fate prediction during the deep water blowouts. Polynomial Chaos Expansion and Gaussian Process Regression are the
tools we are using. I am also interested in different kinds of machine learning
techniques.
