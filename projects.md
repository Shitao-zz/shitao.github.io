# MS Projects

## Forward Propagation of Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analysis in an Integral Oil-Gas Plume Model 
The project concerns with the development, validation and application of
Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) tools to an integral oil plume model. The
[integral plume model] used here is developed by [Dr. Scott A. Socolofsky] using
double plume approach. This project is funded by [Consortium for Advanced
Research on Transport of Hydrocarbon in the Environment (CARTHE)].
