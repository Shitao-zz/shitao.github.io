title: A feature-based loop current shedding prediction using logistic regression
tags: [Loop-current, eddy-shedding, logistic-regression]

> Loop current eddy is tracked using 17cm SSH contour. An classification algorithm 
> of the eddy shedding process is developed by tracking the SSH contour. For the 
> future loop current shedding event, an simple model based on logistic
> regression is presented.
